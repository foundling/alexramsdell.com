## About Me

I'm a software developer in Seattle interested in building edible and accessible user interfaces for the web, software-based musical instruments and useful command-line tools. I like constraints, I throw away a lot of code, and I live to refactor. These days I'm diving into Haskell, contracting here and there and getting a CS degree.
