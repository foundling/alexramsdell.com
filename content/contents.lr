## About Me

Musician, programmer, pedal-builder. Loves to learn, loves call-in radio.

Right now I'm doing these things: <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Forth</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, <a href="https://puredata.info/">PureData</a>, releasing some new albums, building guitar pedals, and re-examining my assumptions about American history and my own personal politics.

Github is [here](https://github.com/foundling). StackOverflow is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2446351/foundling). Projects are [here](/projects). My dumb Twitter is [here](https://twitter.com/drlolzrofl). 
<!--Music is [here](/music). -->

<!--You can see/hear/purchase my guitar pedals at [Dangus Electric](https://www.dangus-electric.com). -->

## My Engineering Values (or hot takes, or naive delusions ... whichever you prefer) 

+ You != your feelings.  
+ Asking questions > looking smart.
+ Clear code > performant code > clever code.
+ Team code convention > personal style.
+ 'Minimal Viable Product' is the gilded philosophical core of our exploitation economy.
+ Mentorship programs are crucial to a thriving, self-aware company culture.
+ A 'senior' developer is equal parts politician and technician.
+ Deep-link early and often.
+ Modals, please no.

## My Favorite Steven Wright Jokes

I lost a buttonhole today.

One time the police stopped me for speeding. They said, "Oh, you know the speed limit is 55 miles an hour?" I said, "Yeah, I know. But I wasn't going to be out that long".
