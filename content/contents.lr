## About Me

I'm a musician, software developer and lover of philosphy. Recently, I've been exploring a wide variety of programming languages including <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Forth</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> and <a href="https://puredata.info/">PureData</a>, building my own guitar pedals from scratch, and digging deeply and widely into American history and consciousness.

Github is [here](https://github.com/foundling). StackOverflow is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2446351/foundling). Projects are [here](/projects). 
<!--Music is [here](/music). -->

[Drexciya](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1172-Drexciya) saved my life!

## My Engineering Values (or hot takes, or naive delusions, whichever you prefer) 

+ Asking questions > looking smart.
+ Clear code > performant code > clever code.
+ Team code convention > personal style.
+ Deep-link early and often.
+ Modals, no.

## My Favorite Steven Wright Jokes


I lost a buttonhole today.

One time the police stopped me for speeding. They said, "Oh, you know the speed limit is 55 miles an hour?" I said, "Yeah, I know. But I wasn't going to be out that long".
