## About Me

I'm a musician, software developer and lover of philosphy. Recently, I've been exploring a wide variety of programming langauges including <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Forth</a>, <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> and <a href="https://puredata.info/">PureData</a>, building my own guitar pedals from scratch, and digging deeply and widely into American history and consciousness.

## My Favorite Steven Wright Jokes

I lost a buttonhole today.

One time the police stopped me for speeding. They said, "Oh, you know the speed limit is 55 miles an hour?" I said, "Yeah, I know. But I wasn't going to be out that long".
